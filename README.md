# Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains several data analysis projects conducted by me. Each project focuses on exploring and analyzing different datasets using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Below is a brief overview of each project:

1. **Credit Card Approvals**
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about credit card applications. The analysis involved exploring the dataset's structure, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and then applying *machine learning techniques* to predict credit card approvals. 

2. **Matplotlib**
The Matplotlib project involved creating various visualizations using the Matplotlib library in Python. I explored different types of plots such as line plots, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize data effectively.

3. **Volleyball League**
For the Volleyball League project, I analyzed data related to men's volleyball league players' performance in a league. The analysis included extracting insights from player statistics, and team for which he plays.

4. **World Population**
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about the world's population over time. I explored trends in population growth, analyzed demographic patterns, and visualized population distribution across different regions.

5. **YouTube Statistics**
The YouTube Statistics project involved analyzing a dataset of YouTube videos' statistics, including views, country from which youtuber is, rank based on number of subscribers, etc. I performed exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in video popularity, viewer engagement, and content categories. 

6. **Data Visualization**
The Data Visualization project focused on creating insightful visualizations on **Google Play store** dataset using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. I explored various techniques for visualizing data, including plotting histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps. I also explored techniwues to plot two plots together using joint plot and plotting multiple charts on multiple columns using pair plot. 

#### Each project folder contains Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) with detailed analyses, code implementations, and visualizations. Feel free to explore the projects and dive into the world of data analysis!
